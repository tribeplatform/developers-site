# OAuth2 SSO

OAuth2 is the recommended and more secure way of implementing SSO between your website and Tribe community. Tribe supports the most common implementations of OAuth2 including _OpenID Connect_.

To be able to use OAuth2 SSO method, your website or product should act as an OAuth2 identity provider. If you're using Okta or Auth0 as your user identity management system you can easily enable OAuth2 protocol since they support OAuth2 out of the box.

Most content management systems have plugins to support OAuth2 as well. For instance, you can use [WP OAuth Server](https://wp-oauth.com/) plugin to add OAuth2 support to your WordPress website.

To enable OAuth2 SSO on your Tribe, you can simply go to the Network Settings and enable OAuth2 under Authentication menu. Before enabling the SSO, you should enter values for Client ID, Client Secret, Authorization URL, and Token URL. These fields are mandatory for enabling the OAuth2 SSO and are available in your identity management system control panel.

## OAuth2 Flow

When OAuth2 SSO is enabled, Tribe will redirect user to your user identity system. If the user is not logged into your website, they will see your login screen. After logging in, Tribe will receive the access token generated by your user identity system and fetches the user's information.

Next, Tribe will create the user using the provided information and log them in if the user does not already exist. If the user exists, it will update the user's information and log them in.

## Identifying User's Existence

Tribe will first try to find the user using the provided id. It will check if any user has externalId equal to provided id. If the user is found, it will update their information including their email address.

If no user is found based on externalId == id, it will try to find the user using the email address provided and connects the user's externalId to the provided id.

:::warning
If a user with externalId == id check does not exist and the user matching with email already has an externalId, Tribe will through a conflict error.

In this case, you may want to update existing users externalId or email using "Update a Specific User" API.
